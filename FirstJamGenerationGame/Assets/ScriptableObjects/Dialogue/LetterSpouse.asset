  - To the love of My Life
  - 'I wanted to thank you for all the time you gave me. For those walks by the river,
    when we first met. For your unconditional love, always. '
  - "From those fast-food-sidewalk dinners to the picnics at the beach with wine.
    My time has come, but I wouldn\u2019t want to see you sad. "
  - "It is ok to cry, but don\u2019t spend your life crying. "
  - You will always be a part of me, for that I know I will always remain with you.
  - 'This is my last farewell, but I hope and pray to the gods, that one day we may
    meet again. '
  - " I will always love you\u2026"
